# AI-MsPacMan
## Artificial intelligence Assignment 2. 

The purpose of the assignment was to give a deeper understanding of decision trees and
the ID3 learning algorithm and how they can be implemented.

We implemented an AI controller for Ms. Pacman that is capable of learning from data
extracted from previous (human) gameplays. This controller had to be a decision tree
trained by means of the ID3 algorithm.
