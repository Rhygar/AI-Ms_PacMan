Assignment 2 Ms Pacman

			******************************************
			*  Small text on how to run our program  *
			******************************************

Run src/pacman/Executor.java with row 90-92 uncommented to see our Pacman agent play. 

All prints on console are redirected to the file David&Johns_DecisionTree.txt

For every run it will print a tree to the file. Erase content before running is a solution.
Tree will not always look the same, even with same data collected, due to randomly selecting what is 
traning data and test data.  
Also comment out line 37-42 in MyPacMan.java will stop writing to file. 

At end of file, the Accuracy of the traning will be displayed. Different everytime, due to randomly selecting what is
traning data and test data.
